# Data Structures Micro Project
This is a straightforward website that can perform the conversion of infix equations to postfix or prefix equations and also features an interesting visualisation of the Fibonacci numbers. It utilises Next.js for server-side rendering and is written in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript respectively.

**Find the live version of the website [here](https://dsu.lebyy.me/).**

## Usage
To use the website, you only need to enter an infix equation into the input form and then click on the button to convert it to either postfix or prefix. Simply clicking on any of the Fibonacci numbers that are shown in the section devoted to the sequence will take you to the visualisation of those numbers.
